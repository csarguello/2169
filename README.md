# 2169

2169 is a math based game where the objective is to combine 4 numbers by adding/subtracting/multiplying/dividing, in order to meet a target number.
Everything from code, to music, to assets were made 100% by me. 
React Navigation is used for the screen navigation and dark/light themes.
Expo AV is used for the music.
Async Storage is used to save progress.
Everything else was made with React Native.
Android version coming soon.
It is currently on the Apple Store here: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/2169/id1639250014
